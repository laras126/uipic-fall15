class_description: Do designers really need to know how to code? In a word...yes. In this course you will learn to create mobile-ready, web prototypes in HTML and CSS. You will understand the overarching structure of web applications and interfaces, and develop the vocabulary necessary to effectively communicate your designs to developers. The class will culminate in creating a prototype of your own design.

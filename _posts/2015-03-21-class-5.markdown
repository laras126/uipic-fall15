## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Frameworks, pros and cons

* Third party tools, what are they and when to use them?
* Framework vs. Grids - what's the difference?
* Look at BS vs. Foundation vs. style guides
* About class based systems
* Dependencies and updating
* How do these things make money?
	* Reputation economy and open source
	* Spin-offs, e.g. [Foundation classes](http://zurb.com/university/courses)

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

* BS documentation (funny to abbreviate it BS...)
* Code a basic layout
* Practice using inspector to figure out classes
	* Reference the [Bootstrap examples](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples)
* Customization best practices - where should our CSS go?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Make something in BS

Pairing is optional here, and I'll be available for additional Q & A about assignments and general code stuff. 

You can design freely or work from the following:

* Create a signup form
* Add a Jumbotron
	* Change the font
	* Add a background texture - [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) is a good resource
* Change the color of the buttons
* Create a thumbnail gallery

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Foundation

* What's the difference?
* A look at the grid
* Download and set up for customizing
	* A look at [Foundation templates](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html)
	* Install the Sublime package 'HTMLBeautify' if you like (template markup is messy when you download it)
* Define Sass and Less

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Same as above!

Again, feel free to design on your own, or work through the following (basically same as above so you can compare):

* Create a contact form
* Change some form styles:
	* Round the corners of inputs
	* Change the background color of the box when it is selected i.e. in focus
	* Make the labels all uppercase
* Create a thumbnail gallery
* Use a [Building Block](http://zurb.com/building-blocks/)
* Create an [icon bar](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/icon-bar.html)
	* Bonus: Make that stick to the bottom of the page

### For Next Time

#### Readings:

Note: JavaScript is a hefty topic, this will be confusing! As usual, it's good to get an idea of what we'll be covering next class. All will become clear then!

* [Shay Howe Lesson 6 (of Advanced HTML/CSS): jQuery](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/jquery/)

About best practices (at least scan them if you have time):

* [CSS: Just Try and Do a Good Job](https://css-tricks.com/just-try-and-do-a-good-job/) - CSS-Tricks
* [Code Smells in CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/) - CSS Wizardy

#### To do:

Find a website using Bootstrap or Foundation (not from their examples page) - see if you can recognize them in your day-to-day web surfing. Inspect the site's source and see if you can find a reference to BS or Foundation classes (BS is more common for sure).

* In other words, get used to inspecting the hell out of websites
* Also keep an eye out for clearfixes

And if you want extra practice (optional):

* **[Download these files](http://stuff.notlaura.com/downloads/uipic-extra-practice.zip)** and work through the items in todos-1.txt then todos-2.txt.

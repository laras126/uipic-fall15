## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Show:</span> Bootstrap and/or Foundation findings

* Also demo and locate a clearfix
* Quick review of layout and framework concepts

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> JavaScript Conundrum and Concepts

* We aren't getting into JS too much, why?
* Why is it so different than HTML and CSS, but usually lumped together with them?
* Programming vs. Coding
* Review of back-end
* Introduce concept of types of functions and libraries
* Breaking down behavior: Variables, Functions, and Logic
* Real life examples (it's not so easy!)
	* Data sanitization
	* Users
	* Passing data

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Noodling

* Work in the console. 
* Go over types of variables, native functions, and objects.
* Download starter files, and work in a file instead of console.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Independent:</span> Work time and Final Projects

* Work on any past projects or exercises 
	* Maybe Bootstrap/Foundation from last time 
	* Extra practice exercises from last class Todos
* Lara comes around to discuss final projects and next steps
* Review and explain any relevant concepts

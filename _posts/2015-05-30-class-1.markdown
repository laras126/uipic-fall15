## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Intros, Syllabus, and whatnot
* Hi!

	* Course work (read through info page)
	* Grading
* Get set up with Cloud9
	* Introduction to the text editor, previewing, etc.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Exercise:</span> Code!

Sure, you can work from scratch but that's not quite how it works in the real world. Let's introduce some code through this starter kit.

[Clone this](https://github.com/laras126/class1-uipic-welcome) in Cloud9. We'll get started together, and go over some basics.

#### Break!

* Why in code?
	* A look at [Instacart](http://instacart.com/store)
	* Check out processes are a good example: [Task Rabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/)
* Some real world examples
	* Brad Frost's [Foodbank prototype](http://foodbank.bradfrostweb.com/patternlab/v3/patterns/03-templates-03-program-detail/03-templates-03-program-detail.html#)
	* Bearded's [HTML wires for AAH](http://aafh-css.herokuapp.com/wireframes), see [this article](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-comping-obtaining-signoff-with-mockups).
	* My [DiJiFi prototype](http://dijifi-wireframes.herokuapp.com)
	* [Onlyinpgh](http://stuff.notlaura.com/demos/oip-mockup) - defunct startup I was in (these were from when gradients were more popular, don't judge!).
	* [Mr. Bottles](http://stuff.notlaura.com/demos/mrbottles) - from an assignment for a site redesign, focus on content.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Exercise:</span> Continue coding, demos.

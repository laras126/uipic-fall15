### For Next Time...

#### Readings:

* [Just](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28) - By [Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com), e.g. the god of RWD. About learning technical skills, and that everyone feels stupid.
* [Make your Mockup in Markup](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup/) - This is an old article (2009?!) but was one of the first about designing in the browser, and still very relevant.
* [How CSS Selectors Work](http://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/) - Somewhat a review, but take a look.
* [Shaw Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) (tutorial) - Also a review, but look through the first few lessons and fill in any gaps.

#### Doings:
* Go to the [Links page](/links), download various apps, and explore the links.
* Continue working in the Welcome files, and maybe use some techniques you learn in the tutorial above.

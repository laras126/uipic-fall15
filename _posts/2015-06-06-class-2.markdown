## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Readings 
	
* The difference between front-end languages
* Websites vs. Webapps

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> The New Process

* What was the old process?
	* PSD to HTML
	* No code
* The New Process (different for everyone, this is based on Stephen Hay's [Responsive Design Workflow](http://www.responsivedesignworkflow.com/) and all things [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com))
	* Designing in text
		* Notes for [DiJiFi](https://github.com/laras126/dijifi-theme/tree/master/_notes	) and [MTNmeister](https://github.com/laras126/mtnmeister-theme/blob/master/content-list.md)
		* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and creating hierarchy
	* Breaking content into components and form a layout systems
		* [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/about.html) and templating
	* Now the visual design layer (Photoshop, you can come out now)
		* [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es)
		* [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/)
		* Tools
			* [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)
			* Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign (ID can be good, encourages typography systems)
	* Style guides (developers love these)
		* [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io)
		* [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io)
			* [Lonely Planet](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours)
			* [Mailchimp](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/)
* A middle ground: Code generators (meh.)
	* [Maccaw](http://macaw.co/)
	* [Adobe's Project Parfait](https://assets.adobe.com/link/b8ecd6b6-94ac-468c-9cfa-b2c666c81a6c?section=extract)

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Exercise:</span> Do it!

* Select a project (could be an existing website or something you are working on)
* Create a text list of the information
	* Is there a consistency in the type of content across all pages or views? (hint: yes)
	* How can you group that content, into what kind of modules?
* Turn that list of text into a diagram-ish thing that indicates modules

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Demo:</span> Code questions

* Demo any questions, or style a pretty button and form.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Exercise:</span> Continue on Process exercise

* Add markup to the page

<div class="post-todos notice" markdown="1">

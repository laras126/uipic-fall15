## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Final Projects:</span> Work Time and Discuss

For the first half of class, I'll walk around and check in on projects and general questions. You can work on your project or the extra practice exercises.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Templating

* Data
	* Types of databases
	* JSON
* What are frameworks?
* What is templating? Why is it awesome?
* Separating content, logic, and data
* MVC (no need to memorize what this means too much)
	* [Read more here](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mvc-for-noobs--net-10488)
* Templating concepts
	* Includes and partials
	* Extends
* Templating languages, look at examples
	* [Ruby on Rails (Erubis)](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/) ```<h1><%= person.name %></h1>```
	* [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com) ```<h1>{{person.name}}</h1>```
* Data for that in JSON would look like:

	{
		"person": {
			"name": "Lara",
			"location": "NYC"
		}
	}

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Handlebars templating

Create a new workspace in Cloud9 and clone the project with this link: https://github.com/laras126/handlebars-starter. You can use this for your final project. Recommended, not required if you'd rather use plain HTML.

* What's happening on the server (PHP includes) vs. client (JS)

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Work time:</span> Create templates for final project

With or without templating kit.

### For Next Time

#### Todo:

* Have all pages and files created for final project. Plan out markup and begin styling, have all content and graphic assets ready to go.
* Find a meet-up to go to! (or just come to [the one on the 20th](https://nvite.com/CodePenMeetupNYC/ed55))

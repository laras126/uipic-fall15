## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Reading

* Does everyone need to code? We touched on this the first class, but let's delve a little deeper.

Anyone want to show their app?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Let's talk floats

* How was the exercise?
* Discuss floats and CSS layouts...confusing, huh?
* Demo
* Start exercise together

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Work on exercise

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Q/A + Demos

* If one of you know the answer, you can explain it!
* Revisit app and expand on layout and styles

#### <span class="post-title-pre">If time:</span> Continue working

* Either on layout exercise or app
* Lara available for 1-on-1 Q/A

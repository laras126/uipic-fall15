## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Frameworks, pros and cons

* Third party tools, what are they and when to use them?
* Framework vs. Grids - what's the difference?
* Look at BS vs. Foundation vs. style guides
* About class based systems
* Dependencies and updating
* How do these things make money?
	* Reputation economy and open source
	* Spin-offs, e.g. [Foundation classes](http://zurb.com/university/courses)

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

* BS documentation (funny to abbreviate it BS...)
* Code a basic layout
* Practice using inspector to figure out classes
	* Reference the [Bootstrap examples](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples)
* Customization best practices - where should our CSS go?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Make something in BS

Pairing is optional here, and I'll be available for additional Q & A about assignments and general code stuff. 

You can design freely or work from the following:

* Create a signup form
* Add a Jumbotron
	* Change the font
	* Add a background texture - [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) is a good resource
* Change the color of the buttons
* Create a thumbnail gallery

#### Break

#### Final Projects
* [Example from last class](https://preview.c9.io/ambikaroos/met-app-prototype/index.html)

### For Next Time

#### Readings:

Note: JavaScript is a hefty topic, this will be confusing! As usual, it's good to get an idea of what we'll be covering next class. All will become clear then!

* [Shay Howe Lesson 6 (of Advanced HTML/CSS): jQuery](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/jquery/)

About best practices (at least scan them if you have time):

* [CSS: Just Try and Do a Good Job](https://css-tricks.com/just-try-and-do-a-good-job/) - CSS-Tricks
* [Code Smells in CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/) - CSS Wizardy

#### To do:

Find a website using Bootstrap or Foundation (not from their examples page) - see if you can recognize them in your day-to-day web surfing. Inspect the site's source and see if you can find a reference to BS or Foundation classes (BS is more common for sure).

* In other words, get used to inspecting the hell out of websites
* Also keep an eye out for clearfixes

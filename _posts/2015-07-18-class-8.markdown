## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Final Projects:</span> Work Time and Discuss

For the first half of class, I'll walk around and check in on projects and general questions. You can work on your project or the extra practice exercises.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Templating

* Data
	* Types of databases
	* JSON
* What are frameworks?
* What is templating? Why is it awesome?
* Separating content, logic, and data
* MVC (no need to memorize what this means too much)
	* [Read more here](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mvc-for-noobs--net-10488)
* Templating concepts
	* Includes and partials
	* Extends
* Templating languages, look at examples
	* [Ruby on Rails (Erubis)](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/) ```<h1><%= person.name %></h1>```
	* [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com) ```<h1>{{person.name}}</h1>```
* Data for that in JSON would look like:

	{
		"person": {
			"name": "Lara",
			"location": "NYC"
		}
	}

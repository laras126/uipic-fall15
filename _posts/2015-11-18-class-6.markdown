## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Final Projects:</span> Work Time and Discuss

For the first half of class, I'll walk around and check in on projects and general questions. You can work on your project or the extra practice exercises.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> jQuery

* Review fundamental programming concepts
* What is jQuery and what does it do?
* Basic syntax and Selectors
* Snow White demo

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Plugins

* When to use them
* Where to find them
* How to use them

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Exercise:</span> Use a Plugin

* Install [FartScroll](http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/), lolz.
* Something more useful: [Fittext.js](http://fittextjs.com/)
* Lots of nice ones on [Unheap](http://unheap.com).

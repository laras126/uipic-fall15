## The Plan

* Look at links
* Discuss this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Two CSS properties walk into a bar.&#10;&#10;A barstool in a completely different bar falls over.</p>&mdash; Thomas Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/493790680397803521">July 28, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Readings 
	
* How do these relate back to prototyping?
* How about that weird text stuff we did last week?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> About Apps

* Native vs. Web vs. Webapp
* Advantages/disadvantages

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Prototype

* About environments
	* We'll be using [Cloud9](http://c9.io), Sublime is still relevant!
	* Introduce Git and Github
* Look at existing text (clone in Cloud9 workspace: git@github.com:laras126/webapp-exercise.git)
	* Emphasize mobile first/device agnostic design, turning an mobile app into a website or webapp
	* Create pages for views
* Plan a component system
	* Add markup
	* What might our classes be called?
	* Where would we use wrappers for a layout?
	* Review difference between classes and IDs
* Add wrapper tags for components

####  Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Review-ish

* Check-in - how are the tutorials going? Easy or overwhelming?
* Floats and clearfixing
* Mobile first, introduce media queries 

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Prototype

* Add some layout in larger sizes inside media queries (already in stylesheet)
* Add stuff in head to remove URL bar and add touch icon
* View and add to homescreen on your phone!

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> If extra time

* Continue with adding layout
* Add another page to the app

<div class="notice post-todos" markdown="1">

### For Next Time

#### Readings:

* [Please Don't Learn to Code](http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/) - huh.

#### To do:

* Post a code question to Disqus on [the next class page]({{ "/class/2015/03/14/class-4.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* Feedback questionnaire (will email the link)
* Add another page to the app and email to me for feedback (optional)
* **Recreate this layout and email me a zipped file**, [starter files here](http://stuff.notlaura.com/downloads/layout-exercise.zip):

![layout]({{ "/img/layout-exercise.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

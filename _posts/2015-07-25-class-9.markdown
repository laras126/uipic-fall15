## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Forms vs. Inputs
* ```<form>``` vs. ```<input type="">```
	* Posting the values with ```action=""```
	* Look at Google
* ```<input type="">```
	* text
	* radio
	* submit
	* number
	* phone
	* password
	* range
	* file
	* ...[and more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#Attributes)!
* Adding additional attributes
	* name
	* value
	* placeholder
	* disabled
	* ...[and more]()!
* How name and action attributes interact
* Labels
	* ```<label for="name">```
* Common types
	* Radio = true/false
	* Checkbox = select mutliple
	* Dropdowns: ```<select>``` and ```<option>```
		* A note about the UX - [interesting article here](http://smarterware.org/7388/the-case-against-drop-down-identities).
* Examples
	* [Taskrabbit.com](https://www.taskrabbit.com/)
	* [Food bank donate form](https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org)
* Basic [form tutorial here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp).

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Demo:</span> PHP Form
* Look at form PHP code - [files here](http://stuff.notlaura.com/demos/php-form-demo.zip).
	* It's kind of gross looking code, don't be intimidated.
	* Show variable values in url, e.g. ```?name=Lara```
	* Writing to mood.txt
	* Example without method and action
* Add a new field
* Styling forms (it kind of sucks)

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Demo:</span> jQuery Plugin

* Demo a JS plugin.
	* [FartScroll](http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/), lolz.
	* Something more useful: [Fittext.js](http://fittextjs.com/)
	* Lots of nice ones on [Unheap](http://unheap.com).

#### Work Time and Q/A

### For Next Time

Keep working on projects! Email questions if you have them. You should have a nice markup skeleton, all of your pages in place, and have started styling.

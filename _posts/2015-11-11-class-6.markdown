## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Final Projects:</span> Work Time and Discuss

For the first half of class, I'll walk around and check in on projects and general questions. You can work on your project or the extra practice exercises.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> jQuery

* Discuss fundamental programming concepts
* What is jQuery and what does it do?
* Basic syntax
* Snow White demo

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Work time</span>


<div class="notice post-todos" markdown="1">

### For Next Time

#### Todo:

* Bring any Final Project questions
* Work through the [jQuery extra practice](https://github.com/laras126/jquery_exercise) tasks if you like

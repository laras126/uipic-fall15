## Class Format


#### Pair Programming

> Pair programming (sometimes referred to as peer programming) is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.


## Course Work


#### 1. Participate




#### 2. Do the Tutorials

This course covers __a lot__ of material, and we can't do all of it in class. Each week I will assign tutorials to make sure you have the appropriate background for what we cover together. Learning the syntax of HTML and CSS is something you can easily do on your own, and I want to teach you what you can't as easily learn on your own.


#### 3. Go to a Meetup

Go to at least one Meetup or other industry gathering during the course and report back. See the [relevant Links section]({{site.baseurl}}/links#meetups) for suggestions.



#### Final Project

This can be of your choosing, or based on a few prompts I provide. Ultimately, it will be a live website at your domain, ready for inclusion in your portfolio.

#### Misc 

I may occasionally ask one of you to present to the class what I call a "clickhole" (a path of links you explored while learning a specific topic), an interesting bit of code you found, or a site critique.

## Grading

Grading is simply based on attendence and completion. Code quality certainly plays a role, but everyone learns at their own pace and the most important part is your participation.

For full credit, you must:

* Miss no more than 2 classes
* Complete all Assignments by the end of the course
* Complete misc tasks assigned to you ("clickholes", code presentations, etc.)
* Final project live on the web at your domain

Partial credit:

* Miss no more than 4 classes
* At least 50% of Assignments are completed
* Complete misc tasks assigned to you ("clickholes", code presentations, etc.)
* Final project live on the web at your domain

Should you complete less than what is listed above, you will recieve an incomplete for the course.


## Materials

### Computers

**If you have a laptop, bring it.** Though you are free to use the lab computers, I highly recommend that you BYO so that it is set up for your work outside of class time. 

If you _don't_ have a laptop, you will need to bring a hard drive (USB drive is fine, at least 5GB) to store your files and the required software.

### Required Software
All of the following are available for free.

#### [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
This is the industry standard for text editors. The lab computers do not have it (but will soon), so if you are using them you will need to install it on your thumb drive by downloading the application and dragging it onto the drive.

#### [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
Chrome is the most popular browser used by web developers. While other browsers do have similar capabilities, we will be using Chrome in class.

#### [Panda Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-hacker-news-dribbbl/jhiocdmmaannaccoofjfmjpbfkogmnap?hl=en)
Panda is a Chrome extension that turns your opening tab into a news feed of popular web design, development, and user experience blogs. Staying up to date with the latest and greatest is essential for this material, and Panda provides a nice, easy way to do so.

#### [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/)
Spectacle is an app for window management. While it is not critical to development, it is essential that you develop an efficient workflow, and window management is a key component of that.

**Slack:**<br>
{{site.slack}} <br>
Slack is a super awesome chat-room esque resource for teams. We'll use it for keeping track of logistics, links, and questions throughout the week.

**This site:**<br>
Apart from Slack, all information lives on this website. The [links page]({{ "/info/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) has a ton of resources (though barely scratches the surface!) and I hope to answer most questions about the course itself on this page. 

Each week I will post details about the coming class in the [Classes]({{ "/classes/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section. You'll notice that future classes aren't completely laid out yet - I like to plan as we go so that we can account for any new concepts or trends that come up as the course progresses. That being said, if you would ever like to work ahead, let me know and I can provide some guidance.

## Class Format

#### Flipped Classroom

A ["flipped classroom"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) means that technical and linear content is learned outside of class time via tutorials and videos. Learning code itself is easily accomplished on your own, and I want our in-class time to be as valuable as possible, and will be spent discussing concepts and solving problems together.

With that in mind, missing a class is critical. Try not to if you can help it, though the class post will be there for your reference.

#### Pair Programming

When coding in class, we'll sometimes pair program. As the wise Wikipedia states:

> Pair programming (sometimes referred to as peer programming) is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.

Coding ability doesn't matter here, so be ready to teach or learn from your partner.

#### Demos and Q &amp; A

Though the majority of code learning will happen outside of class via tutorials, we will, as a class, work through a specific problem or question or give feedback on a piece of code. I might ask one of you to explain the solution or lead the review.

## Course Work

#### Tutorials and Assignments

As mentioned above, tutorials will be assigned to guide your coding know-how. I will also give you "Assignments", or checklists of coding tasks to make sure you have caught on to all of the concepts.

#### Research

A huge part of learning to code is staying up to date with the latest and greatest. At the beginning of each class, we'll discuss current events in the industry and you'll be expected to post a link or two in Slack before the class. 

To find links, you can do this:

1. Via [Panda](https://usepanda.com/app/#/) (listed below) or some other site, find an interesting article. Read it.
2. When you see a link embedded in the article, open it in a new tab, but keep reading the article (if you want).
3. Look at those other links, and open their embedded links.
4. You'll probably start researching a specific topic, and learning about prominent industry names and websites.


#### Final Project

Create an HTML/CSS prototype ready to be tested by users on all types of devices. You will be evaluated on use of:

* A grid and layout system
* Not making it pretty (it should be gray and white with boxes)
* Content (even though it's a prototype, real, or apparently real, content is important)
* Does it work?

The prototype can be for any type of interactive application, be it an app, website, or even a game. The goal is to have something testable that accurately represents the content needed and provides a lovely foundation for visual design. A few ideas:

* Do you have an idea for an app or website? Prototype it.
* An unsolicited redesign. Is there a company you would love to work for, and think you could improve their product? Well, do it! ["How to get the Work you Want"](http://danielmall.com/articles/how-to-get-the-work-you-want/) by Dan Mall, has some great advice.
* Pick a prompt from [briefbox.me](http://briefbox.me/category/design-brief/ui-app/).

You should start thinking about this immediately - make it something you are proud of! And utilize any of the skills you are learning in the other UI/UX courses.

## Grading

Grading is essentially pass/fail, though you will get a letter grade. This is simply based on attendence and completion - code quality certainly plays a role, but everyone learns at their own pace and the most important part is your participation.

For full credit, you must:

* Miss no more than 1 class
* Complete all Assignments by the end of the course
* Participated in link sharing and discussions
* Completed your final project as described above

Blah, blah, blah, just put the work in!

## Materials

### Lab Computers and [Cloud9](https://c9.io/)

We'll be coding using the lab's desktop computers and in a browser environment called Cloud9. It's pretty awesome, and you'll be able to view your work online and continue with it on your own computers outside of class.

### Software (for working at home)
All of the following are available for free.

#### [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
Although we'll be using Cloud9, you are more than welcome to try out a real text editor on your own computer. Sublime is the industry standard for text editors, and you'll probably see me using it in demos.

#### [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
Chrome is the most popular browser used by web developers. While other browsers do have similar capabilities, we will be using Chrome in class.

#### [Panda Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-hacker-news-dribbbl/jhiocdmmaannaccoofjfmjpbfkogmnap?hl=en)
Panda is a Chrome extension that turns your opening tab into a news feed of popular web design, development, and user experience blogs. Staying up to date with the latest and greatest is essential for this material, and Panda provides a nice, easy way to do so.

#### [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/)
Spectacle is an app for window management. While it is not critical to development, it is essential that you develop an efficient workflow, and window management is a key component of that.

## Office Hours

I am in charge of [Office Hours at CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/lodge/office-hours), and during the class, you are welcome to participate. They are every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at varying times. I host once per week and on the other days, another super talented staff member from CSS-Tricks will host. These are a fantastic resource; I hope you take advantage of them!
